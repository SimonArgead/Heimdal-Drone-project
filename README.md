# Heimdal-Drone-project
A drone project in which I work with ROS2 (Jazzy) and Gazebo (Harmonic V8.9.0) simulator.

Current issue:

The current issue in this project is that mavros crashes. This could be due to: Mavros starts multiple times/starts multiple nodes.

Dependencies:

ROS2 Jazzy

Gazebo Harmonic

Ubuntu 24.04 (recommended)

RTABMAP, obtainable from here: https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap

And the ros2 version: https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap_ros

ArduPilot

Mavros2
